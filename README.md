# TI84 Falling Pixel
A game I made for TI calculators when I was in highschool.

You play as a small line who falls. At the beginning of each round 50 dots are drawn on screen. Your goal is to reach the bottom without hitting any dots.

This is the first coding thing I ever made and I'm posting this on my GitHub for nostalgia reasons.

Code was compiled into a runnable program using [this tool](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/).
